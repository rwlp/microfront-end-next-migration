# Migration Microfrontend Portfolio
## Description
This is a migration project using micro front-end.
From: react + node express + stylecomponets
To: Nextjs + tailwind.

## Hi from the author: 
- Hello World! This is a repo just to show my skills in micro-front-end and not a colaborative project. 
  But feel free to send me suggestions, I'll really appreciate feedbacks.

## Main Technologies
- Typescript
- Node.js
- Express
- Vite + React.js
- Redux
- Docker
- PostgreeSql
- Prisma
- HTML/CSS
- Github
- Next
- Tailwind
- TDD

## Important Notes
 - Main Goal: Switch between tecnologies whitout pause production application, and improve new features. 
 - For better visualisation we put new and old version at the same repository(in pratical situations this isn't recommended), 
 - olderVersion use evenBus pattern to establish communication with new front-end(in pratical situations is recommended a shell/container for orquestration)
 - the new frontend run as a webservice that servers parts of front end app (deployed using vercel.com because we are using NextJs)
 - We use TDD to new features but don't apply TDD in older code.
 - You can see the project management [here](https://github.com/users/rwlp/projects/1)
